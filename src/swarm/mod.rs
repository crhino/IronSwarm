// Swarm Peer-to-Peer Networking
//
// Agent's should have knowledge of their neighbors/connections, this module is
// to ensure knowledge transfer through the entire swarm. This module will also
// be used to ensure the self-healing nature of the swarm's network and make sure
// that a partition does not take place. Adding an agent or removing an agent from
// the swarm is also the responsibility of this module.
