// Artifact in the Swarm Ecosystem
//
// An Artifact is a resource that Swarm Agents can interact with. Artifacts are
// discovered by Agents locally and knowledge of Artifacts is dispersed throughout
// the Swarm using either the INFO or BROADCAST RPC, depending on the associated
// importance of a particular Artifact.
